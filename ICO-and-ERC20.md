## ICO on the Ethereum blockchain

It is a smart contract deployed on Ethereum. There is usually a set of limited coins / tokens.
They have:
- a date from which they can be bought
- an initial fixed price

The standard pattern is the ERC20 token.
There is a repository dedicated to Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) & Ethereum Request for Comments.
ERC20 is just a standardized set of functions
