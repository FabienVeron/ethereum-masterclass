## What is a library ?
* A smart contract
* Lives on a address
* Cannot have storage
* Cannot hold ether
* Re-usage does not contaminate the blockchain

There is no standard library for now but many currently in development like OpenZeppelin

A library internally uses DELEGATECALL. It delegates the whole context. From the library POV it looks like this is just another contract.
A library always starts with the keyword ```library C {}```

A library is not like inheritance. The linking happens at bytecode level
* The compilation leaves a place holder for the library address
* Without filling in the address the bytecode is invalid
* Linking is a simple **replace** operation with address of the library

### Upgradability
* Not directly as we can't modify a code that is deployed on the blockchain
* Working on upgrading the address of the library using proxy like openzeppelin.org

There is no storage. This is more a pointer from a function to another function.
```function insert(Data storage self,uint value)```
* first parameter in a library function with *storage* keyword
* Pass by reference i/o pass by copy

### Events
A library can fire an events but it will be shown like the calling contracts is firing events not the library

### Functions overloading
Using BigInt for uint;
Will call first the BigInt library instead of uint

### Importing
```
import "filename";
import * as symbolName from "fileName";
```

### Truffle Package manager
