# Solidity security and best practices

## What is a library ?
* A smart contract
* Lives on a address
* Cannot have storage
* Cannot hold ether
* Re-usage does not contaminate the blockchain

There is no standard library for now but many currently in development like OpenZeppelin

A library internally uses DELEGATECALL. It delegates the whole context. From the library POV it looks like this is just another contract.
A library always starts with the keyword ```library C {}```

A library is not like inheritance. The linking happens at bytecode level
* The compilation leaves a place holder for the library address
* Without filling in the address the bytecode is invalid
* Linking is a simple **replace** operation with address of the library

### Upgradability
* Not directly as we can't modify a code that is deployed on the blockchain
* Working on upgrading the address of the library using proxy like openzeppelin.org

There is no storage. This is more a pointer from a function to another function.
```function insert(Data storage self,uint value)```
* first parameter in a library function with *storage* keyword
* Pass by reference i/o pass by copy

### Events
A library can fire an events but it will be shown like the calling contracts is firing events not the library

### Functions overloading
Using BigInt for uint;
Will call first the BigInt library instead of uint

### Importing
```
import "filename";
import * as symbolName from "fileName";
```

### Truffle Package manager

* Solc(not recommended to use directly): can clone a github repo and do an import for the mapping + additional parameters on the command line with solc
* Truffle: EthPM is the new package registry for Ethereum or using NPM or regular source files in a folder
* Remix: as it is running in the cloud we can import directly a github URL as the mapping. Can import from SWARM

### Send Ether

.Send() or Call.Value():
* Return boolean
* Low-level function
* Some case of re-entry attacks in the past
* **Do not propagate exceptions**
* ```send``` sends the minimum of gas which is 2300

. Transfer() function:
* Now the preferred way to transfer ether
* Propagate gas
* Propagate exceptions

## Exceptions
In solidity we can throw exception but we can't catch them.
There is no message we just revert everything and throw the exception

**Better solution** is assert / require
```assert(1 == 1)```
```require(balance >= amountToWithdraw)```
If not true we will throw an exception in both cases

### Assert style exceptions
- Examples: Division by 0, ArrayOutOfBoundExceptions, Shift by negative amount, ...
- Consume all the gas if they are thrown
- Manually assert throw the same category of exception
- Revert all the changes that were made

### Require style exceptions
- Return all the gas
- Revert all the changes that were made as well
- ```throw``` should now be replaced by ```require(argument)``` which evaluates to false
- Calls another contract which throw an exception
- Create another contract which throws an exception
- ```.transfer()``` fails
- Recieves ether without the ```payable``` modifier

## Difference between tools and frameworks
* Remix IDE: perfect to start off a new project. Works in the cloud. Part of MIST
* Truffle: a little bit better than IDE. Deployment to the blockchain. Integration of testing
* Since version 3+ does not come with JavaScript framework. Need webpack, grunt, gulp, browserify or anthing else
* Angular, Vue, React, Redux for Front End development. Nothing to do with solidity. They use web3.js
* Webpack, browserify, node: 
  - Webpack: packs a bundler of JavaScript and friends
  - Browerify: bundle javascript only
  - NPM: Can download JavaScript modules from the node
  
## Security concerns on Ethereum

* Everything you use in a smart contract is publicly visible, even local variables and state variables marked ```private```
* Random depends on miners (does not really exist)
* To avoid re-entrency hacks [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/security-considerations.html#re-entrancy) emerged

### Gas limits and loops
* Be careful of loops
* Might not be the case for constant functions but still:
  - Constant functions might be called from other functions inside a transaction
* Being explicit in the contract docs

### Sending / receiving ether
* Cannot be 100% sure that the contract cannot receive ether
  - If the contract address is used for mining, no matter there is a ```payable``` modifier for a function or not
  - Self destruct (contractaddress)
  
 * Receiving ether without a specific function calls the fallback-function
  - If none available it throws an exception
 
 ### Call stack depth
 * Maximum call-stack: 1024
 * Low level function like call, callcode, delegatecode will return false if the callstack is depleted
  - **Need to check** the return value of those low-level functions
  
 ### Msg.sender vs Tx.orgin
 * Never use Tx.origin for an authorization
 * A contract can be tricked into thinking you are authorized via a third party
 
**VULNERABLE WALLET CONTRACT EXAMPLE**
```
contract TxUserWalletVu {
  address owner;
  
  function TxUserWallet() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
  
  function transferTo(address dest, uint amount) {
    require (tx.origin == owner);
    dest.transfer(amount);
  }
}
 
contract TxAttackWallet {
  address owner;
  
  function TxAttackWallet() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
  
  function() {
    // The attack
    TxUserWallet(msg.sender).transerTo(owner,msg.sender.balance);
  }
}
```

If a third party calls the TxAttackWallet to transfer some ether, the attack wallet will actually use this third party origin to transfer some ether back to itself (assuming the third party wallet had some ether in with the VulnerableWallet.
```tx.origin``` contains the third party wallet address **NOT** the TxAttackWallet address
